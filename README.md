## Harry Potter Hangman Game
This game was created using javascript arrays and a filter function to prevent guessing the same letter more than once. If else statements determine whether the user guess is included in the word and update the DOM accordingly. If else statements are also used to determine win or loss.

## Getting started
This simple game requires no installations to run. Simply clone the repo and open the index.html file in a browser.

## Technology used
* HTML5/CSS3

## Playing the game
* Game starts when you press any letter key to make your first guess.

* If you get 6 incorrect guesses you lose.
* Click "Play Again" to reset the game.
